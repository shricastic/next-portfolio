## What is BlockCertify?
BlockCertify is an innovative system that allows admins to dynamically create educational/course completion certificates, storing them securely on both MongoDB and the blockchain. The blockchain ensures immutability, enhancing trust and security.

## Technologies
1. **React**
2. **Express**
3. **Ganache**
4. **Truffle**
5. **MongoDB**
6. **Solidity**
7. **Javascript**

## Key Features
1. **Dynamic Certificate Generation**: Admins can create certificates on-demand, ensuring up-to-date information and reducing manual errors.
2. **Immutable Records**: Certificates contain name, course, completion date, PRN, and a unique hashcode.
3. **Cost Savings**: By leveraging blockchain, we reduce the need for physical storage and eliminate the risk of forgery, leading to significant cost savings.
4. **Hashcode Verification**: The hashcode, generated by hashing the certificate details, is printed on the certificate.
5. **Verification Portal**: Firms can verify certificates by entering the PRN and hashcode on our portal.

## Why Blockchain?
Blockchain's immutable nature guarantees that once a certificate is created, it cannot be altered, ensuring authenticity and reducing fraud. This not only secures the credentials but also simplifies the verification process.

## Additional Benefits
1. **Increased Efficiency**: Automating the certificate generation process reduces administrative workload and speeds up issuance.
2. **Scalability**: Our system can handle large volumes of certificate requests, making it ideal for institutions of any size.
3. **Environmental Impact**: Reducing paper use and storage needs contributes to a more sustainable solution.

## How BlockCertify Works
1. **Admin Creates Certificates**: Details are stored in both MongoDB and the blockchain.
2. **Certificate Issued**: Contains all necessary information, including a unique hashcode.
3. **Verification**: Companies or anyone can verify the certificate via our online portal using the PRN and hashcode.

## Who Can Benefit?
- **Educational Institutions**: Secure issuance of course completion certificates.
- **Employers**: Easy and reliable verification of candidate credentials.
- **Students**: Enhanced credibility and trust in their certifications.
